        <p>MyFitnessDiary Terms Of Use</p>

        <p>By registering for MyFitnessDiary, accessing and using our services, you are agreeing to all our terms of use.</p>

        <h5>1. Members and Visitors</h5>
        When you register and join the MyFitnessDiary Service, you become a Member. If you have chosen not to register for
        our Services, you may access certain features as a “Visitor”.

        <h5>2. Change</h5>
        We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policies from time to time. If we make material
        changes to it, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the
        opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If
        you object to any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or
        send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms.

        <h5>3. Service Eligibility</h5>
        To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be a real human, (2) you will only have one MyFitnessDiary
        account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by MyFitnessDiary from using the
        Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered
        on behalf of others.

        <h5>4. Your Account</h5>
        Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) try to choose a strong and secure password; (2) keep your
        password secure and confidential; (3) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections). You are
        responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.

        <h5>5. Notices and Messages</h5>

        You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Service, or
        (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree
        to keep your contact information up to date.

        <h5>6. Limits</h5>

        MyFitnessDiary reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and
        your ability to contact other Members. MyFitnessDiary reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your
        account if MyFitnessDiary believes that you may be in breach of this Contract or law or are misusing the Services.

        <h5>7. Automated Processing</h5>

        We will use the information and data that you provide and that we have about Members to make recommendations
        for connections, content and features that may be useful to you. For example, we use data and information about
        you to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date helps us to
        make these recommendations more accurate and relevant.
